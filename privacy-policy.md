# Privacy Policy for AI PDF Splitter

**Effective Date:** July 8, 2025

At **AI PDF Splitter**, your privacy is not just respected — it’s built into the foundation of the app.

## No Data Collection

AI PDF Splitter does **not collect, store, transmit, or share** any personal information or document data. All PDF analysis and AI processing happens **entirely on your device** using a local language model provided by [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).

## No Internet Dependency

The app functions **offline by design**. It does not require an internet connection, nor does it connect to any remote servers, APIs, or analytics tools.

## Third-Party Tools

AI PDF Splitter relies on the open-source [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) platform to run local AI models. Please review Ollama’s own privacy policy if you use their services outside of this app context. However, **AI PDF Splitter does not transmit any data to Ollama or any third parties**.

## Security by Simplicity

Because the app performs all operations locally and does not include any network features, your documents and personal data remain secure and private on your own Mac.
